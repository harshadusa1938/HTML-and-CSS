    <p>
        Native Americans (also called Aboriginal Americans, American Indians, Amerindians or indigenous peoples of
        America) are the people and their descendants, who were in the Americas when Europeans arrived. There are many
        different tribes of Native American people, with many different languages. There are more than three million
        Native Americans in Canada and the U.S. combined. About 51 million Native Americans live in Latin America.

        Sometimes these people are called Indians, but this may be confusing, because it is the same word used for
        people from India. When Christopher Columbus explored, he did not know about the Americas. He was in the
        Caribbean but thought he was in the East Indies, so he called the people Indians.
